The task is to build a web app which will pull data from an API source and display the details. The app will connect to https://newsapi.org/ and fetch news articles.

## Features
* A screen which shows top 10 headlines
* Users should be able to search for articles. Search needs to be dynamic (hit the API server)
* Clicking on the headline should take the user to the article with the option to get back to the mail screen.
* The app has to be responsive

 

## Other Requirements

* User reactJS, preferably create-react-app.
* Use the https://newsapi.org/ api to retrieve the data.
* Pay attention to semantics: any HTML might work, but choosing the right tags shows you care.
* Show us you know how to create a modern user interface using CSS or any CSS preprocessor / CSS-in-JS.
* Send multiple requests to the news api concurrently
* Handle error and exception conditions.
* Give importance to user experience. Let the user know what is happening in the background.
* Comments will have added value.


## Deliverable
The deliverable for this task should be a zip file or github repo containing the react application. You should make sure that itâ€™s easy to start the application.
