# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Configuration
you need to configure a .env file at the root of this project.
You can rename the .env.example file in the project to .env and add **your** api key

example :
```
REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=4b58f4c308db3236ab12b94075d50ad6
REACT_APP_NEWS_API_URL=https://newsapi.org/v2
```
## Installation

You need to run `npm install`in order to download and install the required packages

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
